#Sharpe-ratio
Sharpe ratio was developped by Nobel laurate William F. Sharpe and is used to help investors understand the return of portfolio compared to market risks. The ratio is the average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit risk. 
In this project, I uses two of America tech-giant (NASDAQ:AMZN and NASDAQ:FB) and S&P500 closing price as the benchmark, instead of risk-free rate like government bonds. After examining the data using Sharpe Ratio, for 2016, NASDAQ:AMZN is much better investment than NASDAQ:FB.
